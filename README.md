# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Faith

# My Story
Skydiving excites some, but for me itâ€™s coding! I remember the rush of adrenaline when I created my first game using Scratch in 5th grade. This opened up the world of STEM to me, and I was ecstatic about continuing to make games and explore the field of technology.
- Age 14, hired as a software engineer intern at Toast Inc
- Completed multiple internships throughout high school
- Developed and deployed a successful study application called StudyGroove

# My Purpose
I love teaching elementary students how to code! When my little brother was diagnosed with Selective Mutism, I started teaching him how to develop games so he could express himself through game creation. This motivated me to begin teaching STEAM-related topics to other young students especially those of color.
- Developed STEAM programs at schools within Boston public schools and Cambridge public schools
- Volunteered as a Front-end web developer at a local church

### Collaborative
Collaboration is key! I have sought out other people
                        interested in buil.ding/designing products in an effort
                        to be more collaborative in my work. As a result I have
                        won hackathons and had successful pitches in an entrepreneur
                        program with startup investors.

### Self-Motivated
It is not just about passion! You must be able to
                        motivate yourself to push through the 10 hours of debugging
                        just to realize you forgot a semi-colon. That requires dedication
                        and a willingness to make your application the best it can be. I am a self-motivated learner because I seek out learning opportunities and do my very best to succeed no matter how hard it gets.
