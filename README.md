# My Story
Skydiving excites some, but for me itâ€™s coding! I remember the rush of adrenaline when I created my first game using Scratch in 5th grade. This opened up the world of STEM to me, and I was ecstatic about continuing to make games and explore the field of technology.
- Age 14, hired as a software engineer intern at Toast Inc
- Completed multiple internships throughout high school
- Developed and deployed a successful study application called StudyGroove
- In college I have been a technical co-founder and tech-consultant for various startups
- I am currently a SWE Intern at Liberty Mutual 

# My Purpose
My purpose is to develop products that go beyond economic benefits and truly make a positive impact on people's lives. I am driven by the desire to leverage my technical knowledge and skills to create solutions that address the pain points of individuals, providing them with relief, happiness, or even unexpected joy. It is my passion to uncover needs that people may not even be aware of and deliver products that exceed their expectations. By combining my expertise in technology with an understanding of economics and user needs, I strive to build innovative and transformative products that bring genuine value and enhance the lives of others.

# Why Should You Hire Me

### Collaborative
Collaboration is key! I have sought out other people
                        interested in building/designing products in an effort
                        to be more collaborative in my work. As a result I have
                        won hackathons and had successful pitches in an entrepreneur
                        program with startup investors.

### Self-Motivated
It is not just about passion! You must be able to
                        motivate yourself to push through the 10 hours of debugging
                        just to realize you forgot a semi-colon. That requires dedication
                        and a willingness to make your application the best it can be. I am a self-motivated learner because I seek out learning opportunities and do my very best to succeed no matter how hard it gets.
